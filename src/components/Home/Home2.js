              Hello, my name is <span className="purple">Sami Khan</span>, and I'm a <span className="purple">MERN Stack Developer</span> with
              more than a year of practical experience creating modern, scalable
              web applications. Developing concepts into useful, user-focused
              digital products is my passion.
              <br />
              I've worked with the entire stack
              over the past year, using React to create simple, responsive user
              interfaces, Node.js and Express to manage APIs and authentication,
              and MongoDB to effectively organize data. I like using code to
              solve practical issues and picking up new skills that speed up and
              improve development. Writing clear, maintainable code and
              consistently enhancing the user experience and product quality are
              my main priorities. Projects in this portfolio showcase my
              development, curiosity, and commitment to creating things that
              genuinely workâ€”and work well.
